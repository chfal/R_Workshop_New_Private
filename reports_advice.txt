SCIENCE STUFF
- Telling story with data (shows understanding of data and issue)
- Multiple scientific sources cited (not just news articles, read scholarly papers)

PROGRAMMING STUFF
- Proficiency in navigating R programming
- Cohesive, understandable graphs (is your x variable called "x" or does it have a title/name?)
